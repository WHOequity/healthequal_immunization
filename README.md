# Quantifying inequalities in childhood immunization using summary measures of health inequality: An application of WHO Stata and R 'healthequal' packages

This repository contains codes in Stata and R that were used in the paper **Quantifying inequalities in childhood immunization using summary measures of health inequality: An application of WHO Stata and R 'healthequal' packages**, published in the journal *Vaccines*.

The `healthequal` packages in R and Stata were published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2024 to assist Stata and R users to readily calculate 21 summary measures of health inequality. The following codes provide examples of the application of these packages, using data from the WHO Health Inequality Data Repository. Please see the published paper for further details about the data sources, indicators, dimensions of inequality, and summary measures of health inequality used in the codes. 

The R `healthequal` package is available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/healthequal/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/healthequal/index.html)

The Stata `healthequal` module is available via the Statistical Software Components (SSC) Archive: [https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459324.html](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459324.html)
